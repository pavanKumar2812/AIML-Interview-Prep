Question 1:
A fair coin is flipped three times. What is the probability of getting at least two heads?

Ans) We are flipping a fair coin 3 times, and we want to find the probability of getting at least two heads.
     "At least two heads" means we want the probability of getting either 2 heads or 3 heads.
     Finding probability of exactly 2 heads(X=2) 
           Number of Total outcomes. For each coin flip, there are 2 possible outcomes, heads or tails. So, the total number of possible
           outcomes when flipping the coin 3 times are 2 ** 3 = 8 outcomes.
                            P(X=2) = (n! / r!(n-r)!) * ((probability) ** r) * (probability of getting a failure in one trail) ** n-r
                                   = (3! / 2!(3-2)!) * ( (1/2) ** 2 ) * ( 1 - (1/2) ** 3-2)
                                   = (6 / 2) * (1/4) * (1/2) 
                                   = 3 * (1/8)
                                   = 3/8
    Finding the Probability of Exactly 3 Heads (P(X=3))
          Now, you also need to calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 heads. For this, we can use the same formula
                            P(X=3) = 3! / 3!(3-3)! * ((1/2) ** 3) * ( (1 - 1/2) ** 3-3 )
                                   = 1/8

    Finding the Probability of Exactly 2 Heads (P(X=2))
          P(at least 2 heads) = P(X=2)+P(X=3)
                              = 3/8 + 1/8
                              = 4/8
                              = 1/2
                              = 0.5
Question 2:
A bag contains 5 red balls and 3 blue balls. If you randomly pick one ball, what is the probability that it is red?

Ans) Total Number of Balls = 5 + 3 = 8
     P(red) = 5/8 = 0.625

Question 3:
A fair die is rolled twice. What is the probability that the sum of the two rolls is at least 9?

Ans) Total Possible outcomes 
     Since a fair die has 6 sides, and when we roll it twice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36

      2 → 1 way (1+1)
      3 → 2 ways (1+2, 2+1)
      4 → 3 ways (1+3, 2+2, 3+1)
      5 → 4 ways (1+4, 2+3, 3+2, 4+1)
      6 → 5 ways (1+5, 2+4, etc.)
      7 → 6 ways (1+6, 2+5, etc.)
      8 → 5 ways
      9 → 4 ways
      10 → 3 ways
      11 → 2 ways
      12 → 1 way

      For sum ≥ 9, just sum the counts:
          4(sum 9)+3(sum 10)+2(sum 11)+1(sum 12) = 10
          P(Sum of two die outcome >= 9) = 10 / 36 
                                         = 5 / 18
                                         = 0.2778

Question 4:
A box contains 10 balls:
4 are red,
3 are blue,
3 are green.
If you randomly pick 2 balls without replacement, what is the probability that both balls are red?

Ans) Total Possible outcomes = 4 + 3 + 3
                             = 10

                        P(1st red) = 4 / 10
                        P(2nd red) = 3 / 9

    Now, multiply both probabilities:
                       P(Both Red) = (4/10) * (3/9)
                                   = (12/90)
                                   = 2/15
                                   = 0.1333

Question 5:
A deck of cards has 52 cards(standard deck). If you draw 2 cards without replacement, what is the probability that both cards are aces?

Ans) Total cards in pack of cards = 52
     Total aces = 4

     P(aces) = P(First Ace) + P(eond Ace | First Ace)
             = (4/52) * (3/51)
             = 12 / 2652
             = 1/221
             = 0.0045

Question 6:
A bag contains 5 red marbles, 7 green marbles, and 8 blue marbles. If you randomly pick 2 marbles without replacement, what is the probability that both marbles are green?

                              = 20
     P(both are green marbles) = (7/20) * (6/19)
                               = 42/380
                               = 21/190
                               = 0.1105

Question 7:
A box contains 6 white balls, 4 black balls, and 5 yellow balls. if you randomly draw 2 balls without replacement, what is the probability that one ball is white and the other is black?

Ans) Total number of outcomes = 6 + 4 + 5
                              = 15
     P(one ball is white and the other is black) = ( (6/15) * (4/14) ) + ( (4/15) * (6/14) )
                                                 = 24/210 + 24/210
                                                 = 48/210
                                                 = 8/35

                                   = 210/2730
                                   = 7/91
                                   = 0.0769

                              = 156/2652
                              = 1/17
                              = 0.058

                            = 13800/117600
                            = 23/196
