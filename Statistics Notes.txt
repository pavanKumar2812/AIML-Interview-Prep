#        STATISTICS NOTES
# ==================================

## -- What is Statistics? --
- **Definition:** Statistics is the study of data collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation.
- **Purpose:** Helps in decision-making based on data insights by identifying trends, patterns, and relationships.

# ==================================
#       TYPES OF STATISTICS
# ==================================

1. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Organizes and summarizes data.  
   - Uses tables, graphs, and numerical measures.  
   - **Example:** Calculating the average height of students in a class.

2. **Inferential Statistics**  
   - Uses a sample to make predictions about a population.  
   - Techniques include hypothesis testing, regression analysis, etc.  
   - **Example:** Predicting election results based on a voter survey.

# ==================================
#    POPULATION (N) AND SAMPLE (n)
# ==================================

- **Population (N):** The entire group under study.
  - **Example:** All employees in a company.

- **Sample (n):** A subset of the population used for analysis.
  - **Example:** A survey of 50 employees out of 1000.
          +----------------------+
          |     POPULATION (N)    |  <--- Entire group
          |  (e.g., All students) |
          +----------------------+
                   |
                   |  Sample Selection
                   v
          +----------------------+
          |      SAMPLE (n)       |  <--- Subset of population
          | (e.g., 100 students)  |
          +----------------------+


# ==================================
#       SAMPLING TECHNIQUES
# ==================================

## **Definition:**  
Sampling techniques are methods used to select a subset (sample) from a population to make statistical inferences. 
The goal is to ensure the sample represents the population accurately. 
Sampling techniques are chosen based on the specific use case.

## **Types of Sampling Techniques:**

## **1. Random Sampling (Simple Random Sampling - SRS)**  
   - Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.  
   - **Example:** Picking names randomly from a hat.  

   **Diagram:**
  -----------------------------------
  | Population: A B C D E F G H I J |
  -----------------------------------
             | Random Selection
             v
  -----------------------------------
  | Sample: C  E  H  A  G           |
  -----------------------------------


## **2. Stratified Sampling**  
- The population is divided into groups (strata) based on a characteristic, and random samples are taken from each group. The groups must be non overlapping. 
- **Example:** Selecting students from different grades in a school.  

**Diagram:**
-----------------------------------
| Grade 1: A  B  C  D            |
| Grade 2: E  F  G  H            |
| Grade 3: I  J  K  L            |
-----------------------------------
         |   Sample from each group
         v
-----------------------------------
| Sample: A  D  F  G  J  L        |
-----------------------------------

## **3. Systematic Sampling**  
- Every nth member of the population is selected.  
- **Example:** Selecting every 5th customer entering a store.  

**Diagram:**
-----------------------------------
| A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L |
-----------------------------------
  Sample: C     F     I     L  

## **4. Cluster Sampling**  
- The population is divided into clusters, and entire clusters are randomly selected.  
- **Example:** Selecting entire classrooms in a school instead of individual students.  

**Diagram:**
-----------------------------------
| Class 1: A  B  C  D            |
| Class 2: E  F  G  H            |
| Class 3: I  J  K  L            |
-----------------------------------
         |   Random selection of a cluster
         v
-----------------------------------
| Selected Cluster: Class 2       |
| Students: E  F  G  H            |
-----------------------------------

## **5. Convenience Sampling**  
- Selecting samples that are easiest to reach.  
- **Example:** Surveying people at a nearby mall instead of randomly across the city.  

**Diagram:**
-----------------------------------
| A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L |
-----------------------------------
  Sample (Nearby People): D  E  F  G

#       Variables
# ==================================

## **Definition:**  
A variable is any characteristic, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted. It represents different values in a dataset.

## **Types of Variables:**

1. Based on Measurement Scale:
   a) Qualitative(Categorical) Variables:
      - Describe categories or labels without a numerical value.
      - Example: Gender(Male/Female), Colors(Red/Blue), Blood Type(A/B/O).
   b) Quantitative(Numerical) Variables:
      - Represent measurable quantities and have numerical values.
         - Discrete Variables: Can take only specific values(Whole numbers).
           Example: Number of students in a class, Number of cars in a parking lot.
         - Continous Variables: Can take any value within a range.
           Example: Height(5.6ft, 5.8ft), Temperature(22.5°C, 36.8°C).
2. Based on Relationship with Study
   a) Independent Variable:
      - The variable that is controlled or changed in an experiment.
        Example: Amount of fertilizer used on crops.
   b) Dependent Variable:
      - The variable that is measued and affected by the independent variable.
        Example: Growth of crops(affected by fertilizer)
3. Based on Data Collection
   a) Primary Variable
      - Collected directly from the source.
        Example: Survey response, direct observations.
   b) Secondary Variable
      - Collected from existing records or databases.
        Example: Census data, published research reports.

# ==================================
#    Variable measurement scales
# ==================================

Definition: Variable measurement scales determine how variables are categorized, ranked, or measured. 

There are four types: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio.

1. Nominal Scale (Qualitative)
   - Used for labelling or categorizing variables without any specific order.
   - Characteristics:
      - No numerical value.
      - No ranking/order.
   Examples:
      Eye Color → {Blue, Brown, Green}
      Blood Type → {A, B, AB, O}

2. Ordinal Scale (Qualitative)
   - Used for ranking or ordering variables, but the difference between values is't measurable.
   - Characteristics:
      - Has a meaningful order(ranking)
      - Difference between values are not equal.
   - Examples
         Education Level → {High School < Bachelor's < Master's < PhD}
         Customer Satisfaction → {Poor < Average < Good < Excellent}


3. Interval Scale(Quantitative)
   - Measures variables where the difference between values is meaningful, but there is no true zero.
   - Characteristics:
      - Equal interval between values.
      - No True zero (Zero doesn't mean absence)
   - Examples
      Temperature → {-10°C, 0°C, 10°C, 20°C}  (0°C does not mean no temperature)
      IQ Scores → {85, 100, 115, 130}

4. Ratio Scale(Quantitative)
   - Measures variables with a true zero, where ratios between values make sense.
   - Characteristics:
      - Has equal intervals
      - Has a true zero(Zero means absence)
      - Can perform all mathematical operations(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
   - Examples:
      - Height (0 cm means no height)
      - Weight (0 kg means no weight)
      - Salary ($0 means no earnings)
      - Distance traveled (0 Km means no movement)
      
      Height → {0 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm}
      Weight → {0 kg, 10 kg, 20 kg}
      Salary → {$0, $1000, $5000}

| Scale Type | Type        | Order?  | Equal Intervals?| True Zero?| Example                                      |
|------------|-------------|---------|-----------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Nominal    | Qualitative | ❌ No   | ❌ No           | ❌ No      | Eye color, Car brands, Blood type           |
| Ordinal    | Qualitative | ✅ Yes  | ❌ No           | ❌ No      | Education level, Race positions             |
| Interval   | Quantitative| ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No      | Temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit), IQ score |
| Ratio      | Quantitative| ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes     | Height, Weight, Salary                      |

# ==================================
#      FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION
# ==================================

## Definition:
Frequency distribution is a table or graph that displays how often each value or range of values occurs in a dataset.
It helps in organizing raw data for better analysis and visualization.

## Types of Frequency Distribution:
1. Ungrouped Frequency Distribution – Lists each data value individually with its frequency.
2. Grouped Frequency Distribution – Groups data into intervals (or classes) to simplify representation.

## Example of Frequency Distribution Table:

### Ungrouped Frequency Table
----------------------------------
| Value  | Frequency (Count) |
----------------------------------
| 1      | 2               |
| 2      | 4               |
| 3      | 6               |
| 4      | 3               |
| 5      | 5               |
----------------------------------

### Grouped Frequency Table (Class Intervals)
--------------------------------------------
| Class Interval | Frequency (Count) |
--------------------------------------------
| 0 - 9         | 5                |
| 10 - 19       | 8                |
| 20 - 29       | 12               |
| 30 - 39       | 7                |
| 40 - 49       | 3                |
--------------------------------------------

## Histogram Representation:
A histogram is a bar graph that represents a frequency distribution. Each bar represents the frequency of values in a given interval.


# ==================================
#    CUMULATIVE FREQUENCY
# ==================================

## Definition:
Cumulative frequency is the running total of frequencies as you move through a frequency distribution table. 
It helps in understanding the number of observations below a particular value.

## Types of Cumulative Frequency:
1. **Less than Cumulative Frequency:** Represents the total number of observations up to a certain class limit.
2. **More than Cumulative Frequency:** Represents the total number of observations above a certain class limit.

## Example of Cumulative Frequency Table:

### Less than Cumulative Frequency
--------------------------------------------
| Class Interval | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency (Less than) |
--------------------------------------------
| 0 - 9         | 5         | 5                                |
| 10 - 19       | 8         | 13                               |
| 20 - 29       | 12        | 25                               |
| 30 - 39       | 7         | 32                               |
| 40 - 49       | 3         | 35                               |
--------------------------------------------

### More than Cumulative Frequency
--------------------------------------------
| Class Interval | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency (More than) |
--------------------------------------------
| 0 - 9         | 5         | 35                                |
| 10 - 19       | 8         | 30                                |
| 20 - 29       | 12        | 22                                |
| 30 - 39       | 7         | 10                                |
| 40 - 49       | 3         | 3                                 |
--------------------------------------------

## Ogive Curve:
A graphical representation of cumulative frequency distribution using line graphs.
- **Less than Ogive** is plotted using the upper boundary of class intervals.
- **More than Ogive** is plotted using the lower boundary of class intervals.

# ==================================
#       BAR CHARTS & HISTOGRAMS
# ==================================

1. **Bar Chart**  
   - A bar chart is used for categorical data where each category is represented by a bar.
   - The height of the bar corresponds to the frequency or count of the category.
   - Bars are separate, indicating distinct categories.
   - Used for qualitative (categorical) data.

   Example:
   Category A: ████
   Category B: ████████
   Category C: ██████

2. **Histogram**  
   - A histogram represents continuous numerical data divided into intervals (bins).
      Example: Student age distribution

               Bin 1 (0-10)  : ████
               Bin 2 (10-20) : ████████
               Bin 3 (20-30) : ██████
   - Bars touch each other, representing continuous data.
   - Used for quantitative (numerical) data.

# ==================================
#       OGIVE CURVE
# ==================================
## Definition:
An ogive is a cumulative frequency graph that helps visualize how data accumulates over intervals.

### Types of Ogive:
1. Less than Ogive - Plots cumulative frequency of values "less than" each class boundary.
2. More than Ogive - Plots cumulative frequency of values "more than" each class boundary.

### Example: Less than Ogive Table
| Class Interval | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency (Less than) |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| 0 - 10       | 4         | 4                                |
| 10 - 20      | 6         | 10                               |
| 20 - 30      | 8         | 18                               |
| 30 - 40      | 12        | 30                               |

### Example: More than Ogive Table
| Class Interval | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency (More than) |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| 0 - 10       | 4         | 30                               |
| 10 - 20      | 6         | 26                               |
| 20 - 30      | 8         | 20                               |
| 30 - 40      | 12        | 12                               |

### Graph Interpretation
- The ogive curve is a rising curve.
- The point where the "Less than" and "More than" ogives intersect gives the median of the data.

# ==================================
#       PDF & KDE
# ==================================

1. Probability Density Function (PDF)
   - Represents how probability is distributed over continuous variables.
   - The total area under the curve equals 1.

2. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
   - A smoothed version of a histogram.
   - Provides better visualization of data distribution.
   - Avoids the sharp edges seen in histograms.

# ==================================
#      MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY
# ==================================
Measure of Central Tendency is refers to the measure used to determine the center of the
distribution of the data.

## 1. MEAN (AVERAGE)
   - Definition: The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
   - Formula: Mean (μ) = (ΣX) / N
      - Example:
        Data: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
        Mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5 = 6
   - Effect of Outliers:
     - A very large or very small number in the dataset can **pull** the mean towards it.
     - Example:
       Data: 2, 4, 6, 8, **50**  
       Mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 50) / 5 = **14** (Inflated by 50, an outlier)

## 2. MEDIAN (MIDDLE VALUE)
   - Definition: The middle value when data is arranged in ascending order.
   - Steps:
     1. Arrange data in order.
     2. If odd number of values: Middle one is the median.
     3. If even number of values: Median = (Middle1 + Middle2) / 2
      - Example:
        Data: 1, 3, 7, 9, 12
        Median = 7 (Middle value)
      
        Data: 1, 3, 7, 9, 12, 14
        Median = (7 + 9) / 2 = 8
    4. Effect of Outliers:
        - Median is **not affected** by extreme values.
        - Example:
          Data: 1, 3, 7, 9, **1000**  
          Median = **7** (Unaffected by 1000)

## 3. MODE (MOST FREQUENT VALUE)
   - Definition: The value that appears most frequently in the dataset.
   - Example:
     Data: 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9
     Mode = 8 (Most repeated number)
   
   - Types of Mode:
     - **Unimodal:** One mode (e.g., 3, 3, 5, 7 → Mode = 3)
     - **Bimodal:** Two modes (e.g., 2, 2, 5, 5, 7 → Modes = 2, 5)
     - **Multimodal:** More than two modes.

   - Effect of Outliers:
     - Mode is **not influenced** by extreme values.
     - Example:
       Data: 1, 3, 3, 3, 7, **1000**  
       Mode = **3** (Unaffected by 1000)

# OUTLIERS
   - **Definition:** An **outlier** is an unusually high or low value compared to the rest of the data.
   - **Detection Methods:**
     - **IQR Method (Interquartile Range):**
       - If a value is **below Q1 - 1.5 × IQR** or **above Q3 + 1.5 × IQR**, it is an outlier.
     - **Z-score Method:**
       - If a value’s **Z-score is > ±3**, it is considered an outlier.
   - **Example:**
     Data: 1, 2, 3, 4, **100**  
     Outlier: **100** (Far from other values)
