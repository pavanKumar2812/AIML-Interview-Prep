#        STATISTICS NOTES
# ==================================

## -- What is Statistics? --
- **Definition:** Statistics is the study of data collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation.
- **Purpose:** Helps in decision-making based on data insights by identifying trends, patterns, and relationships.

# ==================================
#       TYPES OF STATISTICS
# ==================================

1. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Organizes and summarizes data.  
   - Uses tables, graphs, and numerical measures.  
   - **Example:** Calculating the average height of students in a class.

2. **Inferential Statistics**  
   - Uses a sample to make predictions about a population.  
   - Techniques include hypothesis testing, regression analysis, etc.  
   - **Example:** Predicting election results based on a voter survey.

# ==================================
#    POPULATION (N) AND SAMPLE (n)
# ==================================

- **Population (N):** The entire group under study.
  - **Example:** All employees in a company.

- **Sample (n):** A subset of the population used for analysis.
  - **Example:** A survey of 50 employees out of 1000.
          +----------------------+
          |     POPULATION (N)    |  <--- Entire group
          |  (e.g., All students) |
          +----------------------+
                   |
                   |  Sample Selection
                   v
          +----------------------+
          |      SAMPLE (n)       |  <--- Subset of population
          | (e.g., 100 students)  |
          +----------------------+

#       SAMPLING TECHNIQUES
# ==================================

## **Definition:**  
Sampling techniques are methods used to select a subset (sample) from a population to make statistical inferences. The goal is to ensure the sample represents the population accurately. Sampling techniques are chosen based on the specific use case.

## **Types of Sampling Techniques:**

## **1. Random Sampling (Simple Random Sampling - SRS)**  
   - Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.  
   - **Example:** Picking names randomly from a hat.  

   **Diagram:**
  -----------------------------------
  | Population: A B C D E F G H I J |
  -----------------------------------
             | Random Selection
             v
  -----------------------------------
  | Sample: C  E  H  A  G           |
  -----------------------------------


## **2. Stratified Sampling**  
- The population is divided into groups (strata) based on a characteristic, and random samples are taken from each group. The groups must be non overlapping. 
- **Example:** Selecting students from different grades in a school.  

**Diagram:**
-----------------------------------
| Grade 1: A  B  C  D            |
| Grade 2: E  F  G  H            |
| Grade 3: I  J  K  L            |
-----------------------------------
         |   Sample from each group
         v
-----------------------------------
| Sample: A  D  F  G  J  L        |
-----------------------------------

## **3. Systematic Sampling**  
- Every nth member of the population is selected.  
- **Example:** Selecting every 5th customer entering a store.  

**Diagram:**
-----------------------------------
| A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L |
-----------------------------------
  Sample: C     F     I     L  

## **4. Cluster Sampling**  
- The population is divided into clusters, and entire clusters are randomly selected.  
- **Example:** Selecting entire classrooms in a school instead of individual students.  

**Diagram:**
-----------------------------------
| Class 1: A  B  C  D            |
| Class 2: E  F  G  H            |
| Class 3: I  J  K  L            |
-----------------------------------
         |   Random selection of a cluster
         v
-----------------------------------
| Selected Cluster: Class 2       |
| Students: E  F  G  H            |
-----------------------------------

## **5. Convenience Sampling**  
- Selecting samples that are easiest to reach.  
- **Example:** Surveying people at a nearby mall instead of randomly across the city.  

**Diagram:**
-----------------------------------
| A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L |
-----------------------------------
  Sample (Nearby People): D  E  F  G

| **Stratified Sampling**  | Dividing population into subgroups      | Sampling students from each school grade     |
| **Systematic Sampling**  | Selecting every nth individual          | Picking every 5th visitor in a store         |
| **Cluster Sampling**     | Selecting entire groups randomly        | Selecting entire classrooms in a school      |
| **Convenience Sampling** | Selecting easiest-to-reach individuals  | Surveying people in a nearby coffee shop     |
